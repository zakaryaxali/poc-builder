Goal
I am intending to create a simple leave planner app that allows me to let my employees add their planned leave dates, auto-detecting conflicts and team coverage gaps. For user interface and experience, please refer to these guidelines (attach or paste design guidelines text)

Key Features
Employee Management - Add employees with their name, role, and team
Leave Requests - Submit leave requests with date ranges and types (vacation, sick, personal)
Conflict Detection - Automatically detects when team members have overlapping leave dates
Coverage Gap Analysis - Alerts when a team has less than 50% coverage on any given day
Persistent Storage - All data is saved automatically and persists across sessions
