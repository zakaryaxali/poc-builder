Build a simple todo list application with the following features:

1. A text input field where users can type new todo items
2. An "Add" button to add the todo to the list
3. A list that displays all todo items
4. Each todo item should have:
   - The todo text
   - A checkbox to mark it as complete (completed todos should have strikethrough text)
   - A delete button to remove the todo
5. A counter showing how many todos are remaining (not completed)
6. The interface should be clean and easy to use

The app should be interactive - users should be able to add todos, check them off, and delete them.
